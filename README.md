# OpenBoard

The Open Board (the project name, but not necessarily the name of the finished application) is under development. The idea behind the site is the place for sharing articles. All advices, remarks and contributions are welcomed!

I'm using XAMPP on my local machine and the root path for the connection is adjust according to my local hard drive. If you want to testing out my projects you need to adjust your own local path of course. My root path is: "http://localhost/php/Aplication/public/home/index", and it's stored in my constant variable in config.php file: 'define ("ROOT_PATH", "/php/Aplication/");'.
